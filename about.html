				The intended structure of this visualization was a martini glass. I did not have time to create the reader-led exploration at the end of the structure. The data for this project came from a wine review dataset on kaggle.com, originally scraped from WineEnthusiast.com. There are three scenes that use this wine review data to answer the question of which wine varieties are the most common in the U.S.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first of the three scenes is a bar chart depicting the number of wine reviews by state. Only reviews for wines made in the United States were used and only states with at least ten reviews are shown in the chart. The bar for California is annotated because it has the most wines reviewed than any other state by quite a margin. This information will be used to make decisions in a later scene.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second of the three scenes is a pie chart depicting the top ten most numerous wine varieties in U.S. wines. Considering how numerous California wines are, the next scene will exclude California to see if the top three wine varieties change at all.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are no trigger events besides the scene navigation at the top of the page.
